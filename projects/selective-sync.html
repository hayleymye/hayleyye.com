      <h2 class="">Project Overview</h2>
      <p class="">To support and sell to larger enterprise customers,
        Merge needed to be able to sync large amounts of customer data efficiently and securely. The existing
        syncing process often pulled all available records, much of it irrelevant, resulting in long sync times,
        higher costs, and unnecessary exposure of sensitive data.</p>
      <p>I led the end-to-end redesign to make <a href="https://help.merge.dev/articles/9113654-selective-sync"
          target="_blank" class="inline">Merge's Selective Sync</a> product a more
        <strong>discoverable, useful, and scalable</strong> way to filter data shared with Merge.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="">The Challenge</h2>
      <p class="">Merge faced three main issues when working with
        enterprise data:</p>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Performance</strong>: Initial syncs for an account could take 12+
          hours due to large data volumes, during which time the customer and end user has no visibility into what
          is happening</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Cost</strong>: Syncing unneeded data increased infrastructure and
          security costs for Merge</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Privacy</strong>: Security-conscious customers needed granular
          control to exclude sensitive PII (Personally Identifiable Information)</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="">Although Merge already offered a data filtering feature,
        adoption was low because the filters were too limited and the user experience was confusing. My challenge
        was to redesign Merge's filtering experience to <strong>increase adoption</strong> and limit the data that
        Merge syncs to only <strong>recent, relevant data</strong>. </p>
      <h3 class="">My Role</h3>
      <p class=""><strong>I was the sole product designer on this
          project</strong>, responsible for leading the end-to-end design process from user research to prototyping
        and final handoff. I collaborated closely with a cross-functional team that included a product manager,
        post-sales, platform engineers, and software engineers. </p>

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="">User Personas</h2>
      <p class="">I developed two key personas to help identify and better
        understand user needs and goals.</p>
      <h3 class="">Existing Merge customer</h3>
      <p class="">This user is an integrations or IT admin at a current
        Merge customer. They are responsible for managing multiple Linked Accounts within Merge.</p>
      <p class=""><strong>User needs:</strong></p>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">They need <strong>fast and reliable syncs</strong> so that their team has
          up-to-date data without long delays</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">They value <strong>clear controls and transparency</strong> to see what
          filters are applied at any given time and easily adjust them if requirements change</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">They're busy, so they prefer <strong>defaults and clear presets</strong>
          that <em>just work</em> for 80% of cases but still allow overrides for edge cases</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="">Enterprise prospect</h3>
      <p class="">This user is a security or compliance decision-maker at
        a large enterprise company evaluating Merge as a solution for integrations. They are responsible for
        ensuring that any vendor can meet strict data security and privacy requirements before signing a contract.
      </p>
      <p class=""><strong>User needs:</strong></p>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">They need to guarantee that <strong>only approved data</strong> is ever
          pulled into Merge's systems</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">They want <strong>granular control</strong> over what gets synced to avoid
          exposing sensitive PII</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">They need <strong>flexibility for end-users to provide consent</strong>
          where required</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="">Research</h2>
      <p class="">We discovered that the existing Selective Sync feature
        had 79 active filters available, but many were <strong>completely unused</strong> by customers, and many
        more were <strong>only used by a single customer</strong>. </p>
      <p class="">Through customer conversations, we uncovered three main
        insights:</p>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">Many users didn't even know they could set up filters because the feature
          was <strong>buried and hard to find</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">Users who <em>did</em> find it often didn't use it because the
          <strong>filters they needed didn't exist</strong> for their specific use case
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">Most customers only needed recent data from just the last <strong>6–12
            months</strong></li>
      </ul>
      <p class="">Building these filters is technically complex — each one
        must be created individually by Merge's platform engineering team, since the filter logic depends on how
        each third-party integration works. This meant we needed to be strategic, starting with the <strong>highest
          impact integrations</strong> in a single category to prove value before investing more engineering time to
        expand coverage.</p>
      <p class="">To prioritize, we ran data analyses to identify which
        categories contained the most stale data. <strong>Ticketing</strong> and <strong>ATS</strong> stood out as
        the biggest opportunities, with a high percentage of data older than a year that could be excluded by
        filtering. We then mapped the integrations within those categories with the highest usage to ensure our
        initial filters would benefit as many customers as possible.</p>

      <h2 class="">Ideation &amp; Solution</h2>
      <p class="">To solve the problems and user needs we uncovered, I
        worked with the product and engineering to deliver a more visible, flexible, and scalable filtering
        experience. The redesigned Selective Sync combines clearer placement in the product, research-backed
        defaults, flexible user controls, and new internal tools to serve enterprise customers more securely and
        efficiently.</p>
      <h3 class=""><strong>1. Selective Sync tab in each Linked
          Account</strong></h3>
      <p class="">The sync filters feature was previously hidden inside each Common Model for a Linked Account. Users
        had to expand each accordion and configure filters for each model separately.</p>
      <div class="image-grid">
        <div class="image-item" style="cursor: pointer; display: flex; flex-direction: column;"
          onclick="openModal('../assets/selective-sync/old-la-overview.jpg', 'Old design: Sync filters in Linked Account Overview')">

      </div>
      <p class="">We added a dedicated Selective Sync tab within each
        Linked Account to make the feature more visible. Users can now see and manage all filters applied to an
        account in one place, giving them a clear at-a-glance view and easy configuration.</p>

          Account</p>
      </div>
      <h3 class="">2. Default timestamp filters</h3>
      <p class="">We introduced default timestamp filters that apply
        automatically when an account is connect to filter out records older than a given date. This reduces initial
        sync times by excluding stale data up front and increases Selective Sync adoption by applying best-practice
        filters without requiring any manual setup. While these filters apply automatically to new accounts, users
        still have the flexibility to adjust or override them at the organization or account level.</p>
      <p class="">As mentioned in the previous section, we launched this
        feature with just the Ticketing category because of engineering bandwidth constraints. The goal is to
        eventually add default filters for all categories. </p>
      <p class=""><strong>Plan gating and upselling</strong></p>
      <p class="">Although Selective Sync is an Enterprise plan feature,
        we implemented default timestamp filters for all Merge users to reduce infrastructure costs. This became an
        opportunity to upsell and encourage Free and Launch customers to upgrade:</p>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">On Free and Launch plans, customers can adjust the default date range in
          the dashboard, but can't delete the filters or add other filter types</li>
      </ul>
      <ul class="bulleted-list">
        <li style="list-style-type:disc">On the Enterprise plan, customers and end users have full flexibility: they
          can edit, remove, or add any filters they need</li>
      </ul>

      </div>
      <p class=""><strong>Relative timestamps</strong></p>
      <p class="">Due to engineering limitations, we determined that it
        made the most sense for default organization-wide filters to have relative timestamps, such as 6 months or 1
        year, but for the same filter to be static when applied to a specific account, based on when the account is
        connected.</p>

      </div>
      <p class=""><strong>Frigade announcement modal</strong></p>
      <p class="">To ensure customers knew exactly what was happening, we
        added a modal in the dashboard using <a href="https://docs.frigade.com/component/announcement" target="_blank"
          class="inline">Frigade's
          announcement component</a> to notify users of the new default filters. This increased visibility and made
        sure there were no surprises for customers when syncing their data.</p>

      </div>
      <h3 class=""><strong>3. User-Configured values in Merge
          Link</strong></h3>
      <p class="">To give customers maximum flexibility, we also added
        support for <strong>user-configured filters</strong>. This surfaces the filters in Merge Link and allows end
        users to control exactly what data is
        synced by setting their own values when connecting their account. A customer can
        choose <em>is user configured</em> as their filter type to let each of their end users
        decide what data should sync based on their specific needs. This approach makes Selective Sync even more
        scalable and privacy-friendly for security-conscious customers.</p>

      </div>
      <h3 class=""><strong>4. Internal Filter Builder</strong></h3>
      <p class="">We developed a new internal Filter Builder tool to enable
        Merge's platform engineers to more easily build and maintain filters for new data models and integrations,
        helping scale support as the feature grows. This is a separate project that is available <a
          href="mailto:hayleymye@gmail.com" target="_blank" class="inline">upon request</a>. </p>
    </div>

    <hr />

    <div class="section">
      <h2 class="">Final Design</h2>
      <p class="">The final redesigned product brings all these solutions
        together into a cohesive experience that balances automation with control. The new Selective Sync tab makes
        filters discoverable and easy to manage for every Linked Account. Default timestamp filters now apply
        automatically to help customers sync only relevant data, with clear plan-based permissions that drive upsell
        opportunities. The Frigade announcement modal keeps users informed, so there are no surprises when new
        defaults are rolled out. </p>
      <p class="">For advanced needs, end users can configure their own
        filters directly in Merge Link for maximum flexibility, and the new internal Filter Builder enables Merge's
        platform engineers to efficiently expand filter coverage as customer needs grow. Together, these
        improvements make Selective Sync a powerful yet easy-to-use feature that scales with Merge's enterprise
        customers.</p>
