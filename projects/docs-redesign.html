            <h2>Project Overview &amp; Introduction</h2>
            <p>As Merge’s API and
                feature set grew, so did the complexity of
                its developer documentation. While the content was valuable, users—both customers and
                prospects—found it hard to navigate without guidance.
            </p>
            <p>I reimagined the information architecture and
                narrative structure of <a href="https://docs.merge.dev/" target="_blank" class="inline">Merge Docs</a>
                to <strong>support self-service, reduce post-sales burden, and better
                    align with how users actually learn about Merge</strong>. Making Merge Docs a more intuitive,
                self-serviced product would not only provide a better user experience, but also drive more
                <strong>top-of-funnel conversion</strong> and <strong>reduce costs to scale</strong>.
            </p>
            <p>Although the redesign was not ultimately implemented,
                this work provided great insights into how we could use storytelling, structure, and navigation to
                support different user journeys.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Challenge</h2>
            <p>Merge’s documentation is dense and technically rich
                but not intuitive to navigate. From my user research, I learned that customers and prospects rely
                heavily on support from the Merge team to learn more about the product.</p>
            <p>The goal was to make Merge Docs a truly
                <strong>self-serve product</strong> and design a documentation experience that supports two distinct
                user journeys:
            </p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Prospects</strong> looking to understand what Merge does and
                    whether it fits their needs.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Customers</strong> looking for implementation details and
                    troubleshooting help.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>My Role</h3>
            <p>
                I initiated this project after noticing recurring friction in how users navigated Merge's documentation.
                As
                the <strong>sole designer</strong>, I led ideation, user research synthesis, and the proposed redesign.
                While primarily a solo effort, I also collaborated with a product manager to write my first product spec
                and
                partnered with solutions engineers to learn about common pain points and validate user journeys. This
                self-driven
                project gave me the opportunity to exercise my product thinking and storytelling skills.

        <div class="section">
            <h2>Research</h2>
            <p>I analyzed data from Fullstory and conducted
                interviews with Merge’s solutions engineers and post-sales to gain insight into how users currently
                learn about Merge and interact with existing documentation. From my research, I summarized a few key
                takeaways and mapped common user journeys.</p>

            <h2>User Journeys &amp; Personas</h2>
            <p>Based on my research, I developed two key personas and
                user journeys.</p>
            <h3>Prospective User</h3>
            <p>This user is evaluating whether Merge is the right
                solution for their team or product. They may be a product manager, founder, or solutions lead—not
                necessarily deeply technical, but familiar with integration challenges. They want to understand Merge’s
                value quickly and assess technical feasibility without getting lost in API details.</p>
            <p><em>“Can Merge do what I need? How hard is it to
                    implement?”</em></p>

            <p>Questions that prospects will typically ask during a demo with a Solutions Engineer, and the page in
                Merge Docs that answers each
                question, respectively. The yellow/orange boxes are common follow-up questions that don’t currently have
                any documentation to answer.</p>

            <h3>Implementation Engineer</h3>
            <p>This user (or someone else on their team) has already
                chosen Merge and is now responsible for setting up the integration. They may be a software engineer or
                technical team member not necessarily involved in the prior evaluation process. They want clear guidance
                on how to implement this new product and are focused on execution and fast delivery. </p>

            <img src="../assets/merge-docs/customer-user-journey.png" width="100%">
            <p>Existing Merge customers typically
                start from Merge’s landing page or from a conversation with their Customer Success Manager, who then

            <p>To address the fragmented experience, I proposed a new

            <h2>Final Design</h2>
            <p>Due to limited engineering bandwidth and competing
                customer priorities, we ultimately decided not to move forward with implementation on this project. Most
                of my work remained at the low-fidelity stage in Figjam. I focused on <strong>wireframes</strong> and
                <strong>structural mockups</strong> to communicate the new information architecture and shared my design
                iterations cross-functionally to incorporate feedback from Product, Sales, and Engineering.

            <p>However, I did create a <strong>high-fidelity
                    prototype </strong>of the<strong> Field Mapping doc</strong> to explore and validate the redesigned
                page layout within the proposed “Implementation” section. This prototype showcased two major
                improvements:</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">A <strong>persistent left navigation</strong> to improve wayfinding and
                    reduce friction while navigating dense content</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">A <strong>scrolling, single-page layout</strong> to support deep
                    reading and minimize context-switching</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Implementation Plan</h3>
            <p>In addition to the wireframes and prototype, I
                outlined a phased implementation plan to help the team prioritize work based on impact and effort. The
                plan was divided into <strong>five milestones </strong>ordered from least to greatest engineering lift,
                focusing on updating the most critical pages first. Each milestone was designed to deliver value
                incrementally to improving the user experience over time without requiring a full overhaul all at once.

            <h2>Insights</h2>
            <p>Although the redesign was paused before launch, the
                project revealed how much opportunity there is to improve the documentation experience by reframing it
                around real user journeys. </p>
            <h3>What we learned:</h3>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Content discoverability matters just as much as content
                        quality. </strong>Users weren’t missing information because it didn’t exist, but because they
                    didn’t know where to look.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Naming and structure strongly influence engagement.</strong>
                    Renaming “Guides” to “Implementation” and grouping starter content into a “Quick Start” section
                    helped better match users’ mental models.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Docs are part of the product experience. </strong>Especially
                    for technical products like Merge, the documentation is often the first touchpoint for prospects and
                    the primary tool for customers post-sale. Developer docs are not just technical references, they are
                    part of the product’s onboarding experience.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Next Steps:</h3>
            <p>If this project were to move into development, the
                next steps I would take are:</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Prototype and usability test</strong> the new layout with real
                    prospects</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Collaborate with engineering</strong> to implement the five
                    milestones I previously outlined</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Quantify impact</strong> by tracking usage patterns in
                    FullStory and support tickets before and after rollout</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc"><strong>Establish a scalable internal system</strong> for maintaining
                    and updating documentation</li>
            </ul>
