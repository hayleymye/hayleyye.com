                data mapping across integrations.</p>

            <h2 class="">Project Overview &amp; Introduction</h2>
            <p class="">In 2022, Merge faced a key integration challenge:
                <strong>how to handle non-standard data across diverse third-party platforms</strong>.
            </p>
            <p class="">Accessing custom data is critical for customers with
                enterprise end users because they rely on systems with specialized data needs that go beyond Merge's
                Common Models. Enterprise platforms are rarely one-size-fits-all, and having the flexibility to extend
                or modify data fields allows businesses to tailor integrations to their specific workflows.</p>
            <p class="">To address the limited flexibility of Merge's
                standardized data models, we launched a beta version of Field Mapping in 2023 to a few selected
                customers. These customers gave us important feedback and insight into how we could make Field Mapping
                more user-friendly and comprehensive. Through iteration and redesign, this feature grew into a
                full-fledged Field Mapping platform that is a <strong>flagship feature</strong> today and is used by
                <strong>over half</strong> of Merge's Professional and Enterprise organizations and supports
                <strong>6,000+ mapping instances</strong> across (as of November 2024).
            </p>
            <p class=""><em>Although I led the design of Field Mapping from
                    its conception in 2022 , this case study focuses on the latest iterations of the feature from
                    2024.</em></p>

            <h2 class="">The Challenge</h2>
            <p class="">Merge's <strong>Common Models</strong> (like
                <code>Employee</code>, <code>Ticket</code>, <code>Candidate</code>, etc.) standardize data across
                platforms such as BambooHR, Zendesk, and Greenhouse. But every platform—and often every company—has
                <strong>custom fields</strong> unique to their use case, such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">"T-shirt size" on an employee record</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">"Urgency score" on a support ticket</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">"Lead source" on a CRM contact</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="">Without support for custom fields:</p>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">This data is <strong>inaccessible</strong> through Merge.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">Integrators must build custom logic <strong>outside</strong> of Merge.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">It breaks the promise of a "unified API" for real-world use cases.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="">Our goal was to make <strong>custom data mapping
                    intuitive, accurate, and scalable</strong>—whether users were mapping an employee's personal email
                or transforming nested JSON fields across platforms like Workday, BambooHR, and Salesforce.</p>
            <!-- <br> -->
            <h3 class="">My Role</h3>
            <p class=""><strong>I was the sole product designer on this
                    project</strong>, responsible for leading the end-to-end design process from discovery and user
                research to prototyping and final handoff. I collaborated closely with a cross-functional team that
                included a product manager, product marketing manager, post-sales, and several software engineers.</p>

            <h3 class="">Key Problems We Identified:</h3>
            <ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="1">
                <li>There were <strong>too many options on the initial screen</strong>, leading to choice overload. We
                    had multiple buttons for adding a mapping to ensure users could create any type of mapping for any
                    Common Model, but this abundance of choices left users feeling confused and overwhelmed—especially
                    given that Field Mapping was a completely new concept they were still learning to grasp.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="2">
                <li>Customers had built thousands of mappings manually, a sign of <strong>high need but also high
                        friction. </strong>We found that many use cases require custom fields that are the same across
                    an integration. </li>
            </ol>
            <ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="3">
                <li>End users couldn't easily self-configure mappings because the Merge Link UI (end-user interface) for
                    Field Mapping was <strong>outdated and unintuitive, </strong>blocking them from customizing
                    integrations and limiting the feature's scalability.</li>
            </ol>
            <ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="4">
                <li>Users did <strong>not feel confident</strong> in choosing the right third-party field. Not all
                    integrations support human-readable field names (for example, a typical field name in Workday:
                    <code
                        class="long">wd:Worker_Data.wd:Employment_Data.wd:Worker_Job_Data.wd:Position_Data.wd:Job_Profile_Summary_Data.wd:Management_Level_Reference</code>)
                    and companies often deprecate and replace fields as they grow. Field names can be
                    <strong>unclear</strong>, and the field type and endpoint were <strong>not enough context</strong>
                    for users to trust their selections. Users would map a field, wait for data re-sync to see what
                    value was returned, and then update the mapping if the value was not what they expected.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol type="1" class="numbered-list" start="5">
                <li>Customers struggled to map <strong>nested or complex fields </strong>(e.g.,
                    <code>List[object]</code>), requiring them to build custom logic outside of Merge, which is the
                    problem Field Mapping (and Merge's Unified APIs overall) sought to address in the very beginning.
                    This issue was particularly common in enterprise applications like Workday, NetSuite, and
                    Salesforce, where custom objects can be complex and extensive, making it difficult to isolate
                    specific fields.

                <li style="list-style-type:disc">We added an optional Advanced Mapping step to the mapping flow to
                    enable users to access nested fields and apply unique business logic within the dashboard</li>

            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">We decided to use JMESPath, a query language for JSON, because even
                    though most customer use cases could be solved by indexing on the <code>List[object]</code> , the
                    order can change so mapping via index can cause errors. </li>

            <ul class="bulleted-list">
                <li style="list-style-type:disc">We implemented an easy <strong>click-to-generate query</strong>
                    functionality to simplify the Advanced Mapping experience for most users, but still gave users the
                    flexibility to write their own complex queries if necessary.</li>

            <h2 class="">Final Thoughts</h2>
            <p class="">Field Mapping is perhaps the most meaningful project
                of my career so far. I started brainstorming for the initial concept just a few months after joining
                Merge in 2022 and continued iterating on it through each update, until the most recent one in December
                2024. As I grew as a designer, I constantly found new ways to improve the feature, iterating on both the
                interface and the user experience.</p>
            <p class="">Reflecting on the process, I would have dedicated more
                time to user testing during the beta phase. Due to tight deadlines, we prioritized shipping quickly,
                relying on hypotheses rather than user validation. Although the final version is successful, gathering
                feedback earlier could have accelerated these improvements.</p>
            <p class="">This project not only greatly enhanced Merge's product
                offering but also deepened my ability to design intuitive, scalable solutions for complex data
                scenarios. Leading Field Mapping from concept to flagship feature taught me how to build products that
                empower enterprise users.</p>
